# What's This Directory About?

This directory contains a clone of our student facing environment.

To use it, please (1) fork it, (2) clone your fork to your local machine, (3) open the new folder in VSCode, (4) let VSCode build and boot the development environment container, (5) open a terminal and run leanproject build. This will take some minutes the first time through but will be much quicker on subsequent development sessions.
